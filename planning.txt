You are a programmer for a new initiative at Princeton called Princeton AI Review.
The goal of this initiative is to create a platform for students to share their research and projects with the world.
We are starting with a simple website that will allow students to create profiles and share their work.
We are using a modern tech stack including Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.
We want the website to feature different sections called: Humor, Technical, Spotlights, Opinion, and News
Furthermore, we want a homepage that looks similar to the WIRED homepage, with spaces for the latest articles.
There should aslo be an About page, that details the goals of the journal.
